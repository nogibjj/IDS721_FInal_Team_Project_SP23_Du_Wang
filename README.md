# IDS721_FInal_Team_Project_SP23_Du_Wang

## Option A:
Build a containerized or PaaS machine learning prediction model and deploy it in a scalable, and elastic platform:

## Options:
1. ML Framework
- Sklearn, MXNet, PyTorch or Keras/TF
2. Model
- Your own supervised ML prediction model or a Kaggle Prediction Model
3. Platform
- Flask + Kubernetes deployed to EKS (Elastic Kubernetes) or Google Kubernetes Engine
- Flask + Google App Engine
- AWS Sagemaker
- Other (Upon Request)

Verify Elastic Scale-Up Performance via Load Test with Locust, Loader.io, or a similar load test framework. (Start with 1 container or endpoint) and verify 2 or more inference endpoints scale up to 1K requests per second.

## Deliverables:
- Source code in Github Project with README.md file that explains the project.
- Demo video showing project scaling to 1K+ requests served by multiple endpoints that scale-up. The video should be between one to five minutes. Videos over five minutes or under one minute will have points deducted.
- One to five minute in-person class presentation
